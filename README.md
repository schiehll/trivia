# Trivia Challenge

> A code challenge proposed by G2i.

## Demo

Here's a [live demo](https://practical-dijkstra-d0b419.netlify.com/) of it.

## Documentation

You can also see a live documentation of the project [here](https://hungry-ritchie-3fd937.netlify.com/).

## Installation

Because we already have a more complete documentation, I will keep the things simple here.

To install the project locally just run `yarn install`.

After that, run `kerbs dev` to see the full documentation locally if you need to. Everythiong is explained there.
