# Overview

This is a code challenge proposed by G2i.

It consists in creating a trivia app, with 10 true or false questions.

It was built using <Link to="react">React</Link>, of course, and it has a perfect score in the <Link to="github" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse">Lighthouse</Link> audit for performance, SEO, Acessibility, and Best Pratices (be sure to run the audits without browser extensions and against the production build).

You can see a live demo of it <Link to="netlify" href="https://practical-dijkstra-d0b419.netlify.com/">here</Link>, on Netlify.
