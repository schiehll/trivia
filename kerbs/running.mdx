# Running

You can run the development server while working on it, and then the build script once you are done.

## dev

To run the development server, you can just do:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

If you modify files inside the `webpack` folder, you will need to restart the server.

## build

To build it for production, run the following:

```bash
$ yarn build
```
