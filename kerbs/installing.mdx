# Installing

First make sure you have <Link to="nodejs">node</Link> installed, with a version equal or greater than `v10.16.3`.

Once you have it in place, all you have to do is install the project's dependencies.

To install the dependencies you should be using <Link to="yarn">yarn</Link> to make use of our `yarn.lock` file, running the following command on your terminal:

```bash
$ yarn install
```
